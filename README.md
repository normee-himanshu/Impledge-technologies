The intution behind this is simple . 
Add all the words to a HashSet.
Iterate on all the words, remove current word from hashset and check if every substring from current word exists in hashset recursively.
Add the word back to hashset once the recursive method returns true or all the characters in string are traversed.
 
 Another way of doing this is by using the trie data structure.
